# WeatherMind AI Agent

Hey there! Welcome to **WeatherMind**, a super cool AI agent built by Manthankumar Bagade (thatâ€™s me!). This project is all about answering your questions with a dash of humor and a lot of smarts. Whether youâ€™re curious about what outfit to wear in Goa, the latest fashion trends in Mumbai, need a quick calculation, or want to dive into something random like machine learning, WeatherMindâ€™s got you covered!

This project is built using **LangGraph** and features a multi-agent system (Level 4 in the notebook) with specialized agents: WeatherAgent, FashionAgent, CalculationAgent, and ResearcherAgent. They work together, coordinated by a DecisionMaker, to give you clear, fun, and accurate responses. Think of it as a team of digital buddies ready to tackle your queries!

## Whatâ€™s Inside?
- **WeatherAgent**: Fetches current weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **FashionAgent**: Digs up the latest fashion trends for a given location via Tavily Search.
- **CalculationAgent**: Handles math expressions like a pro.
- **ResearcherAgent**: Answers questions on any topic not covered by the others, also using Tavily Search.
- **DecisionMaker**: The mastermind that delegates tasks to the right agent and delivers witty responses.

The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook (`Task_2.ipynb`) with four levels of complexity, from a simple calculator agent (Level 1) to a full-blown multi-agent system with memory (Level 4).


## Project Structure
- `Task_2.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with all code, organized into four levels.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies and environment dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file, your guide to the project.
